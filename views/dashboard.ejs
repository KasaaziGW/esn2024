                    ESN is a community platform that can be used by people in different times of emergencies. 
                    When an emergency occurs, a member of the community/citizen can post on the platform and anyone near them can render help such as <em>first aid,</em> or <em>calling for more help nearby.</em>
                    The community has ordinary users also known as <strong><em>Citizens,</em></strong> <strong><em>Coordinators</em></strong> who are leaders at different levels that can follow up on these emergency cases, and <strong><em>administrators</em></strong> who are incharge of assigning different privileges to the system's users as well as perform other system administration tasks.
